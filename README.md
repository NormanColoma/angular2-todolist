# Angular 2 Todolist

This project is based on Angular 2 (2.0.0 final release). The main purpose is to provide a good example
on how to start from the scratch a web application following the official documentation, style guide and Angular 2 best
practices. As you could see, is just a simple todolist application.

## Installing and setting up

Just clone this repository or download the .zip directly.

### Dependencies

Before running the app, you will need to install some dependencies of which run on Node.js. For setting up everything
correctly, just follow the steps below:

1. Download and install [Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Install [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
3. Once you cloned the repository, cd into *angular2-todolist* and run the following command:

> **Command:** npm install

### Back-end Data

The data is being collected from external simple API (which is deployed in Heroku). You can either use it or create
your own.

## Running the application 

Run the following: 

> **Command:** npm install 

Angular CLI and webpack will take care of the rest. After a while, you will see a successfully message. Now just open 
a browser and navigate to *localhost:4200* and we're done!

## Testing 

For the moment I've just written unit test, but I will write e2e test as soon as possible. 

### Unit test 

Type the following command to run unit test:  

> **Command:** npm test

## Forthcoming changes 

* New features 
* E2E test
